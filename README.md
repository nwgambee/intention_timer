## [Intention Timer](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/intention-timer-pair.html)
#### Mod 1 Project 2 - Noah Gambee and Johnny Cassidy

For this project, we were given 4 major iterations (as well as a zero-iteration) to follow. The major iterations are described below alongside their respective comp images.

The goal of this project is to create an app that allows the user to create specific goals regarding their health that they can tie to an amount of time. The app needs to log the users activity and keep track of how the user has spent time in their activities.



#### Iteration 0 - Zero State
The zero state of this iteration is the HTML and CSS layout (shown below). We could not move on into the next iteration until this one was complete.

#### Iteration 1 - Form Functionality
The goal of this iteration was to begin adding functionality with JS. One part of this was to make the category buttons turn a certain color when selected. We also had to ensure that the minutes/seconds input boxes only accepted numbers (and display an error if otherwise). Finally, a timer pops up if the "Start Activity" button is clicked.
